# Ping Tool with Python and Data Visualization

## Overview

This project is a simple Python-based tool that allows users to ping a specific host and visualize the results in their web browser. It uses the `Bottle` web framework to serve the web interface and `Tkinter` for a simple GUI. The ping results are displayed as both raw output and a bar chart generated using `matplotlib` to visualize response times.

## Features

- **Ping Hosts**: Enter a host address (e.g., `x.com`) and get ping statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Ping response times are displayed as a bar chart using Pythonâ€™s `matplotlib`.
- **Simple GUI**: A graphical user interface built with `Tkinter` allows users to input a host address.
- **Web Interface**: The ping results, including a visualization, are displayed in a browser via the Bottle web server.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **Bottle**: A lightweight WSGI micro web framework for Python.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating bar charts to visualize ping times.
- **Tkinter**: Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) for the tool.
- **Subprocess**: Executes the ping command and retrieves the output.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install bottle matplotlib
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. The Tkinter GUI will launch. Enter a host address and click "Ping Host" to open your browser and view the results.

## Usage

1. Launch the application, and a GUI window will appear.
2. Enter the host (e.g., `google.com` or `x.com`) into the text box and click the "Ping Host" button.
3. Your default web browser will open and display the ping results, including:
   - Ping statistics for the entered host.
   - A bar chart visualizing the response times for each ping attempt.
